I'm Austin, a Computer Science major,
            network student assistant, and freelance web developer at Valdosta 
            State University. Some of my passions include programming, web development,
            Linux, and command-line applications. Whether it's building responsive websites,
            crafting efficient CLI tools, or exploring the intricacies of the Linux ecosystem,
            I'm always eager to dive into new challenges and expand my skill set.`,d,f,G=`However, my journey into technology began long before I ever wrote a
            line of code. Even as a child, I was captivated by the mechanics of
            everyday devices and how they operated. Around the age of 10, I
            started taking apart electronics, driven by a curiosity to
            understand what made them "tick." This fascination with technology
            and problem-solving laid the foundation for my career today. While I
            spent some time as a flooring installer, learning the value of
            precision and hard work, my passion for tech has always been at the
            core of my personal and professional growth. Now, I channel that
            same curiosity and attention to detail into programming, web
            development, and exploring the command line.`,k,h,E=`<img src="${S}/images/about/people-renovating-house-concept.jpg" alt="From Flooring to Coding"/> <figcaption>From Flooring to Coding: Building Foundations</figcaption>`,T,v,q=`My interest in programming began during high school when I first
            attempted to write code in Python. Despite my enthusiasm, I
            struggled to grasp many concepts due to the lack of formal teaching.
            I spent countless hours on YouTube tutorials, managing to build
            small apps and simple scripts but never quite feeling confident. It
            wasnâ€™t until the summer before my freshman year that I decided to
            dive into web development, teaching myself the basics to gain a
            "head start." However, it was in my CS 1010 class during freshman
            year that everything truly clicked. With structured guidance and
            formal instruction, programming finally started to make sense,
            propelling me into exploring languages like Java and Rust, as well
            as web development frameworks like Svelte and Tailwind CSS. Today,
            as a freelance web developer and Network Student Assistant, I
            continue to expand my skills, delving into both development and
            networking fundamentals.`,L,w,R=`<img src="${S}/images/about/html-css-collage-concept-with-person.jpg" alt="Deep in Code"/> <figcaption>Lost in Lines of Code</figcaption>`,$,y,W=`Beyond the screen, I'm drawn to exploring a variety of interests. I
            have a genuine love for foreign languages and cultures, along with a

            computers has also become an interesting, hands-on hobby, letting me
            combine my technical skills with my craftsmanship. Gaming,
            especially, is a big passion, and it often fuels my curiosity and
